## ‚òùÔ∏è**Pitch**

Anyone can go out and buy a cookbook these days, but I want a place to store all my secret family recipes, handed down from generation to generation. 

The little cards my grandma wrote the recipes on in her beautiful cursive are getting lost or are hard to read. I need somewhere secure to keep my recipes with me at all times!

## ‚úÖ **MVP**

1. On-boarding process for a new `user`

2. Ability to enter a new `recipe`, including `title`, `source` (ex: Grandma Ethel), `ingredients`, `instructions`, and `category` (dinner, chicken, dessert, pasta, etc) and edit or delete it later.

3. Homepage to view all entered `recipes`.

4. Ability to search for `recipes` by `title` or tagged `categories`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**Stretch**

1. Ability to upload a `picture` of the original `recipe` along with the `recipe` entry.

2. By default all `recipe`s uploaded can only be viewed by the `user` logged in. A stretch goal would add the ability to invite another `user` with the link to view the `recipe`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
